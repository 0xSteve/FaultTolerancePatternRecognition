#Fault Tolerant Topology Control with Pattern Recognition

The goal of this work is to apply techniques of Pattern Recognition (PR) to
solve problems of Fault Tolerance (FT) with applications in  Mobile Ad-Hoc
Networks (MANETs).

This is an early work and the capabilities of PR in MANETs is uncertain at the
moment.

## Underwater Data Collection Experiment

There is a need to test this algorithm for FT Topology Control (TC) and
Topology Maintenance (TM) in the types of communicatio networks where high
latency and low bandwidth are a common performance concern.

In order to ensure some integrity in the work, an experiment in underwater data
collection is being conducted.

The goal is to collect at least 200 unique data-points over a period of
observation while monitoring the environment throughout the water column.

### Physical Layer
The first set of experimental data that is being collected is the signal
intensity.  This portion is two fold. The signal intensity of a standard chirp
is gathered for different positions of the receiver. The second portion of this
data collection is to collect the signal intensity corresponding to know
datagrams.

### Data-Link Layer
The datagrams mentioned in the previous section are those that are used to
collect Bit Error Rate (BER) data for the Data-Link Layer experiment.
