# CAD COMPONENTS
The CAD components make up the various parts required to make the experiment
work. Each component is discussed in the following sections and their purpose
is detailed.

## ANCHOR COUPLER
The anchor coupler may seem trivial at first glance, but this device
facilitates a way to connect or disconnect an Olympic weight plate for use as
an anchor. Once the anchor mounting is fixed to the rope, the length of the
rope can be measured and graduated without ever having to repeat the process,
since the rope is not tied directly to the anchor weight. It also allows the
anchor weight to be changed without changing the length or graduations on the
rope itself.

## ROPE-END MOUNT
This device allows the thermocline measuring device to slip freely against the
anchoring rope. This way the device can have a fixed, and relatively short,
length with a number of sensors that can be moved along the water column.

Using this rope-end mount solves the problem of capacitive loss over distance
of wire that would make it impossible to detect temperature at depths greater
than approximately 15m communication wire. It also removes the need for signal
repeaters, since the signal carrying device can now move freely along the
anchor rope.

The intended use of this device is to have one filled with air to provide
positive buoyancy at the top of the measuring device and the other filled with
BBs to provide negative buoyancy at the bottom of the measure, ensuring that the
sensor rope remains straight.
